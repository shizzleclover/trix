# Introduction

Welcome to the **Trix** documentation. Trix is an interactive project generator built to speed up the development of modern full-stack applications.

## What is Trix?

Trix is more than just a boilerplate. It's a curated ecosystem of templates and modules that are designed to work together perfectly. Whether you're building a lightweight React frontend, a high-performance Fastify API, or a modular NestJS backend, Trix has you covered.

### Why use Trix?

- **Zero Config**: No more spending hours setting up ESLint, Prettier, or Tailwind.
- **Pre-Integrated Modules**: Adding Auth or a Database is as simple as a few keystrokes.
- **Type Safety**: Everything in Trix is built with TypeScript from the ground up.
- **Optimized for Teams**: Consistent project structures make it easier for teams to collaborate.
