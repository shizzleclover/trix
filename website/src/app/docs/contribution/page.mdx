## Development Setup

To start developing locally, follow these steps:

1. **Fork and Clone**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-user/trix.git
   cd trix
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Build the CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Link for Testing**:
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```

Now you can run `create-trix` from any directory to test your changes.

## Project Structure

- `src/core/`: Core CLI logic and configuration building.
- `src/prompts/`: All interactive prompt definitions.
- `templates/`: Handlebars templates for all frameworks and modules.
- `src/generators/`: Logic for generating files and injecting code.

## Adding a New Template

Templates are located in the `templates/` directory. Each template must have a `module.json` file that defines its files, dependencies, and instructions for the CLI.

For more details on the template system, check out the [Advanced Guide](/docs/advanced/templates).
