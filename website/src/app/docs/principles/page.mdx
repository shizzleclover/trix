# Core Principles

Trix is built on four core principles that guide every feature and template we develop.

## 1. Speed is a Feature
Every second a developer spends on boilerplate is a second lost on innovation. Trix is optimized to get you from `create-trix` to `npm run dev` in under 60 seconds.

## 2. Sensible Defaults
We choose the tools that work best together so you don't have to. Our stacks are battle-tested and follow industry best practices for security, performance, and scalability.

## 3. Extensibility without Complexity
Our "Marker" based code injection allows you to add features without needing a PhD in AST parsing. Modules just plug in.

## 4. Type Safety by Default
TypeScript isn't an afterthought in Trix; it's the foundation. Everything we build is strictly typed to catch errors before they reach production.
